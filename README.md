# Code for the Chicago Python talk

This is some code I've put together for a humorous talk at [Chicago Python](https://www.chipy.org/) Spooky Halloween Talks edition.

See the `southern_hemisphere` package for the implementation details.

## Installation

Install the southern_hemisphere package first:

```
pip install southern_hemisphere
```

Then make sure you have jupyter-notebook installed and open the `ChiPy trick or treat.ipynb` notebook, running all cells should mostly recreate the code portion of talk presentation.
