# Code for the Chicago Python talk

This is some code I've put together for a humorous talk at [Chicago Python](https://www.chipy.org/) Spooky Halloween Talks edition.

See the `southern_hemisphere` package for the implementation details.

## Installation

Install the southern_hemisphere package first:

```
pip install southern_hemisphere
```

Then make sure you have jupyter-notebook installed and open the `ChiPy trick or treat.ipynb` notebook, running all cells should mostly recreate the code portion of talk presentation.

## Thanks

Thanks to my company [Scry Engineering](https://www.scrygroup.com/) for helping with this talk and thanks to some of my Python trainer colleagues at [Python Charmers](https://www.scrygroup.com/) for discussing some of the details of Folium and other GIS topics that were involved in this talk.
